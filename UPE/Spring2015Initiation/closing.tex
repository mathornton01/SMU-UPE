Hello Everyone, my name is Vipul Kohli, and I am the current chapter Vice President of Upsilon Pi Epsilon's Kappa Chapter. I am very excited to see so many of you being initiated this year. Congratulations to all of you again, I'll make this somewhat brief, if you didn't sign in already please be sure to do so before you leave. Also be sure to introduce yourself to the four active members who were present here tonight as well as the chapter advisor. And lastely, if you wouldnt mind sticking around for just a few moments directly after you exit, we would like to get a picture of all those who are present here tonight. Again congratulations and we hope to see many of you in the fall at our first meeting. Watch your inbox for any announcements and the monthly newsletter all of which will be prefaced with UPE: in the subject line.
