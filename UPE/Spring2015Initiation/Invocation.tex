\maketitle{}
Supreme creator, 
We seek blessings on the tasks before us.
Bless our efforts with clear  insight,
our deliberations with wisdom,
our work, with clarity and accuracy,
and our decisions with impartiality. 
We thank you for the many blessings of our lives.
Especially that humble automaton the turing machine. 
Let the use of our gifts be favorable in your sight, 
Aid us in the securing of 
information in our modern age, where communications float gently on the four winds of heaven. 
Help us see and implement your grand design with the refined stone, and electricity by which we can perform our humble and meek calculations with greater speed and accuracy than ever before to your glory alone. 
In your name we pray, 
AMEN.
\end{center}
