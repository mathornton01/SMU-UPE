\begin{center}\textbf{Mission Statement}\end{center}

The mission of Upsilon Pi Epsilon is to recognize academic excellence at both the undergraduate and graduate levels in the Computing and Information Disciplines.

The Association will accomplish this mission through programs that enable outstanding students to obtain recognition of superior educational achievement that emphasizes the Computing and Information Disciplines as well as liberal arts, sciences, and other professional and interdisciplinary education in the context of individual and societal responsibilities, assist in maximizing the personal and professional growth of students in UPE by financially supporting scholarships and other creative endeavors that include the discovery, integration, and application of knowledge, establish significant partnerships with external constituencies interested in promoting and subsidizing high quality computing science education,
seek opportunities to extend individual memberships and chapter activities into additional environments yet to become identified.

\begin{center}\textbf{Guidelines \& Goals}\end{center}

Upsilon Pi Epsilon is an honorary society whose membership consists of outstanding undergraduate and graduate students in Computing and Information Disciplines. Only schools that offer a degree in a computing science-related discipline may be chartered. Likewise, prospective student members must be working toward a degree in Computing and Information Disciplines at the time they are considered for membership. Yet members are chosen not only for their scholastic achievement in a computing science program, but also for distinguishing themselves as true professionals by meeting the standards of the society. Membership is limited to those who can effectively achieve the original goals of the society. These goals include:

    The recognition of outstanding talent in the field of computing science,
    The promotion of high scholarship in computing science,
    The establishment and maintenance of high standards in computing science,
    The representation of computing science in interdisciplinary communications, and
    The encouragement of individual contributions to society through computing science.

\begin{center}\textbf{Endorsement \& Affiliation}\end{center}

Upsilon Pi Epsilon is the first and only, existing international honor society in the Computing and Information Disciplines. It has received endorsements from the two largest computer organizations in the world, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the IEEE Computer Society (IEEE-CS).

UPE is a member of the Association of College Honor Societies (ACHS).
